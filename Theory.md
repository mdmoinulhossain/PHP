- PHP statements end with a semicolon (;)
- all variable names are case-sensitive!
- PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive.
- A variable starts with the $ sign

* The PHP var_dump() function returns the data type and value

# echo

- can takes multiple parameter/arguments while `print` takes one, and it's faster than `print`.

# Rules for PHP variables:

- A variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable
- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and \_ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive ($age and $AGE are two different variables)

# PHP Variables Scope

- local - A variable declared within a function has a LOCAL SCOPE and can only be accessed within that function
- global - A variable declared outside a function has a GLOBAL SCOPE and can only be accessed outside a function
- static

# Data types

- String
- Integer
- Float (ex. 1.5)
- Boolean(true/false)
- Array
- Object
- NULL
- Resource
